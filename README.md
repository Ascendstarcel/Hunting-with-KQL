# Threat Hunting with KQL

A comprehensive repository of KQL  threat hunting queries tailored for detecting APT groups, Custom hunts for tools, and emerging zero-day exploits.

## Overview

This repository contains carefully crafted KQL queries designed for use in Microsoft Sentinel and other Azure Monitor environments to enhance threat detection capabilities. It covers:

- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group behavioral detections
- Custom detections for Hak5 tools including Rubber Ducky and related devices
- Zero-day exploit hunting queries for emerging vulnerabilities

## Usage

1. Import these queries into your Microsoft Sentinel environment or your Azure Log Analytics workspace.
2. Customize thresholds and parameters based on your environment and threat model.
3. Schedule regular hunting or detection rules using these queries.
4. Combine with your existing detection and response playbooks.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please create a pull request with your additions or improvements to hunting queries. Ensure queries are well documented.
